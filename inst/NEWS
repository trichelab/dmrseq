Changes in Version 0.99.11 (2018-04-05)
______________________________________

o dmrseq now provides support for detecting large-scale methylation blocks. To
  use this feature, specify `block=TRUE`, and increase the smoothing span 
  parameters `minInSpan`, `bpSpan`, and `maxGapSmooth`. More details are 
  provided in the documentation and vignette.

Changes in Version 0.99.8 (2018-03-21)
______________________________________

o dmrseq no longer requires balanced, two-group comparisons. To run using a 
  continuous or categorial covariate with more than two groups, simply pass in
  the name of a column in `pData` that contains this covariate. A continuous
  covariate is assmued if the data type in the `testCovariate` slot is 
  continuous, with the exception of if there are only two unique values (then a
  two group comparison is carried out).

Version 0.99.6 (2018-03-02)

o dmrseq is now available on Bioconductor devel (3.7) !
