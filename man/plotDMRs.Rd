\arguments{
\item{BSseq}{An object of class BSseq.}

\item{regions}{A data.frame containing the DMRs (output from the main
\code{dmrseq}) function.}

\item{testCovariate}{integer value or vector indicating which of columns of
\code{pData(bs)} contains the covariate of interest. 
This is used to construct the sample labels and colors (unless this is
over-ridden by specifying \code{label}).}

\item{extend}{Describes how much the plotting region should be extended in
either direction. The total width of the plot is equal to the width of the 
region plus twice extend.}

\item{main}{The plot title. The default is to construct a title with 
information about which genomic region is being plotted.}

\item{addRegions}{A set of additional regions to be highlighted on the 
plots. Same format as the \code{regions} argument.}

\item{annoTrack}{a \code{GRangesList} object with two elements returned
by \code{\link{getAnnot}}. The first
contains CpG category information in the first element (optional)
coding gene sequence information in the second element (optional).
At least one of these elements needs to be non-null in order for 
any annotation to be plotted, but it is not necessary to contain
both.}

\item{col}{The color of the methylation estimates. It is recommended to 
leave this value as default (NULL), and specify a value of 
\code{testCovariate} to indicate which column of \code{pData(bs)}
to use as a factor for coloring the points and lines of the plot.
Alternatively, you can specify particular colors by 
passing this information through the \code{pData} slot of the
object \code{BSseq} (a \code{data.frame} that houses metadata). To do 
so, place the color value for each sample in a column titled \code{col}, 
and leave this argument as its default value of NULL. Alternatively,
you may specify a vector of color values (one for each sample), but 
you *must* make sure that this vector is in the same order as the samples
are in the BSseq object. If NULL and no \code{col} column is found in 
\code{pData}, then estimates are plotted in black for all samples.}

\item{lty}{The line type of the methylation estimates. It is recommended to
pass this information through the \code{pData} slot of the
object \code{BSseq} (a \code{data.frame} that houses metadata). To do 
so, place the line type value for each sample in a column titled \code{lty}, 
and leave this argument as its default value of NULL. Alternatively,
you may specify a vector of line type values (one for each sample), but 
you *must* make sure that this vector is in the same order as the samples
are in the BSseq object. If NULL and no \code{lty} column is found in 
\code{pData}, then estimates are plotted with \code{lty=1} for all samples.}

\item{lwd}{The line width of the methylation estimates. It is recommended to
pass this information through the \code{pData} slot of the
object \code{BSseq} (a \code{data.frame} that houses metadata). To do 
so, place the line width value for each sample in a column titled \code{lwd},
and leave this argument as its default value of NULL. Alternatively,
you may specify a vector of line width values (one for each sample), but 
you *must* make sure that this vector is in the same order as the samples
are in the BSseq object. If NULL and no \code{lwd} column is found in 
\code{pData}, then estimates are plotted with \code{lwd=1} for all samples.}

\item{label}{The condition/population labels for the plot legend. If NULL
(default) this is taken from the \code{testCovariate} column of 
\code{pData}. Alternatively, you can pass in labels by 
adding this information through the \code{pData} slot of the
object \code{BSseq} (a \code{data.frame} that houses metadata). To do 
so, place the labels for each sample in a column titled \code{label}, 
and leave this argument as its default value of NULL.
You may instead specify an arbitrary vector of labels (one for each sample),
but be aware that you *must* make sure that this vector is in the same order 
as the samples are in the BSseq object. If NULL, and \code{testCovariate} is
also NULL and no \code{label} column is found in 
\code{pData}, then no legend is created.}

\item{mainWithWidth}{logical value indicating whether the default title
should include information about width of the plot region.}

\item{regionCol}{The color used for highlighting the region.}

\item{addTicks}{logical value indicating whether tick marks showing the
location of methylation loci should be added. Default is TRUE.}

\item{addPoints}{logical value indicating whether the individual 
methylation estimates be plotted as points.}

\item{pointsMinCov}{The minimum coverage a methylation loci need in 
order for the raw methylation estimates to be plotted. Useful for filtering
out low coverage loci. Only used if addPoints = TRUE. Default value is 1 
(no filtering).}

\item{highlightMain}{logical value indicating whether the plot region 
should be highlighted.}

\item{qval}{logical value indicating whether the region FDR estimate
(q-value) should be displayed in the plot title. The value is extracted 
from the \code{regions} argument.}

\item{stat}{logical value indicating whether the region statistic 
should be displayed in the plot title. The value is extracted from the
\code{regions} argument.}

\item{verbose}{logical value indicating whether progress messages 
should be printed to the screen.}

\item{includeYlab}{a logical indicating whether to include the Y axis
label 'Methylation' (useful to turn off if combining multiple region
figures and you do not want to include redundant y axis label information)}

\item{compareTrack}{a named GenomicRangesList item that contains up to four
custom tracks (GenomicRanges objects) which will be plotted below the region.
Only one of `compareTrack` or `annoTrack` can be specified since there is
only for plotting either the built in GpG category and exon tracks, *or* a
custom set of tracks.}

\item{labelCols}{a character vector with names of the mcols slot of the 
GenomicRanges items in `compareTrack'. Only used if plotting custom
tracks using the `compareTrack' argument. If specified, the (first) value
in that column is printed along with a label that includes the name of the
list item. If NULL (default), just the name of the track is printed.}

\item{horizLegend}{logical indicating whether the legend should be 
horizontal instead of vertical (default FALSE). This is useful if you need
to plot many labels and want to preserve whitespace.}

\item{addLines}{logical indicating whether to plot smooth lines between 
points. Default is true. Can be useful to turn this off for very small 
regions.}

\value{
None (generates a plot)
}
\description{
Generates trace plots of methylation proportions by genomic position.
}
\details{
Creates aesthetially pleasing DMR plots. By default will plot individual
points with size proportional to coverage, along with a smoothed line 
for each sample. Elements will be colored by biological condition 
(\code{label}). Also has functionality to add annotations below the main
plot (CpG category, genes) if \code{annoTrack} is specified.
